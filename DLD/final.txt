Note:
In the below topics, focus only on whatever I have covered in the class. First, study all the concepts by referring to classroom discussions, then orient your preparation by referring to the assignment and class exam question papers. This is more than sufficient to score high marks in the exam. 
Don't complicate it; keep it as simple as possible with high conceptual clarity. 
This is a very simple course; don't miss out on the opportunity to score high.
